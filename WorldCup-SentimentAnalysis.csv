Allez Les Bleus. France used to suffer immensely in soccer I still remember losing in 2010 France was so depressing losing every match I cried. We had a decent team but not what we were used to when Henry, Deschamps, Zidane, or even thuram but look now. I'm not being negative this is my opinion you can either accept or not but disagreeing with me doesn't make something negative. The MLS is going to improve unless they start drawing young talent that's isn't Carlos vela he's 3.5 star player at best you need those 4-5 star players like Foden, Ali, Greenwood, Fernan, or Chiesa. It comes down to the tactics usa uses compared to European or South American Clubs. European teams typically run a false nine or they have 2 mids one attacking and one defensive, they also constantly watch their lines go look up Thomas Muller 2010 world cup performance to this day that is the best play I have seen from a player at that level. Alot of Europe is balanced soccer it isn't heavy on the attack or defense but more to the tune of the momentum. The thing usa lacks deeply is height. South American clubs make up for the lack of height with the crazy attack style they play and It's heavy on the counter attacks. 
The US just isn't their financially to afford these players either nor would they get love. Pirlo one of the greatest to play came to New York FC and during an interview he said he loved the MLS because he was just a regular person kot many knew him when he played for Juve he said he would be locked in the stadium for 3 hours after matches due to how crazy fans got over his popularity.",1,1649209549,

Getting the only silver goal in history (game ended after we scored from a corner at 105' after defending for the whole match and the silver goal rule was abolished after the tournament). Losing to Russia who had 0 points and 0 goals before the  third group stage game even though we werent guaranteed to advance to the quarters. Starting a center forward that couldn't score in the serie b . Then to top it off we went and lost our first world cup qualifier a few months after the euros to Albania. Shit is fucking hilarious.

And sure, the game became exciting because of that last play that shouldn‚Äôt have happened (the foul was incorrectly called) but wherever, it is what it is there..
Now Argentina-France had other kind of spices.  Returning World Cup champion Vs Copa America Champions. Two stars, one on his prime, the other one what we thought be his last bit of brilliance in his career. The final literally had it all. 4 goals in regulation time, team dominance for 80 minutes and a big comeback in the last 10. Extra time, another 2 goals in extra time, and then the penalties. I mean, what else can a fan asks for? Maybe to make it more exciting they should‚Äôve gone to penalty sudden death‚Ä¶ but hey, that would have meant a few people would have did of a heart attack!

If I were to describe, arg and France is like watching two very skilled martial artists fight in a ring. Both have proven themselves to be powerful and the match is definitely the best of the best.
Arg and Netherlands is like watching two young budding angry kids rolling in the mud, pulling hairs and kicking shins just to come up on top.

But it‚Äôs undeniable that this WC had everything:
* Surprises in the group stage with small teams winning against great teams (Saudi Arabia vs Argentina, Tunisia vs France, Morocco vs Belgium).
* The 8 groups were extremely tight until the very end and at least one of the two qualified teams had very passionate definitions: with head-to-head matches (Ecuador-Senegal at GrA, Iran-USA at GrB, Australia-Denmark at GrD, Belgium-Croatia at GrF); or doing maths while watching the two final games (Mexico and Poland in GrC, Germany and Japan in GrE, Uruguay and Korea in GrH). Even Brazil was one goal away of getting the second place.
* Great teams getting surprisingly knocked out in the group stage (Germany and Belgium) and underdogs qualifying (Morocco and Korea, or Japan getting the first place of its group).
* The only ‚Äúboring‚Äù games (because there was only one team on the field) in the whole knock-out stage where Portugal-Switzerland and Brasil-Korea, and maybe Argentina-Croatia. Every other game was really tight, and even the ones with a bigger score difference (like England-Senegal, France-Poland or Netherlands-USA) showed two very competitive teams at least for the first half.
* There were 5 penalties shootout with some pretty intense moments (like Netherlands-Argentina or Spain-Morocco).
* An African team reaching the semifinals, and almost reaching to the finals because they were very close to tie the game against France.
* And, of course, the very f*cking best WC final ever with an extremely dominating team, an almost dead team that came back to life in 80 seconds from a 0-2, an extra time with clear opportunities for both teams, the best save in the history of football (because it was a great Dave in the last minute that could‚Äôve been the championship for France) and a penalty shootout.

it's pathetic to even try to protect Qatar when this ia known fact with every kind of evidence you could wish for. (documents, contracts, photos, videos, testimonies, etc)
FYI the match was not the best ('98, '02).  And it's not the point of this thread. This is you: ""We got a good final so who cares about basic human rights?""
From an article:
\- Despite important reforms to the kafala sponsorship system, migrant workers in Qatar are still tied to their employers who act as their official ‚Äúsponsor‚Äù (kafeel) from the moment they enter the country and throughout their employment. Migrant workers cannot themselves request or renew their residence permits and it is the responsibility of the sponsor to do so. However, if the sponsor fails to renew the permit, it is the worker who faces punishment.
\- One Kenyan employee of United Cleaning said:  
‚ÄúFor five months I had to live with very little food and no salary. My family was really affected. Tears come to my eyes when I remember where we used to go to find food‚Ä¶ in the bins.  
‚ÄúAfter two years and five months of working with United Cleaning without taking any vacation, the company owes me a lot of money which they refuse to pay me. If I get it I can go home to my wife and son.‚Äù",1,1681994811,

Born with HGH deficiency with a good chance he might not even play football unless he's given super expensive injections which he couldn't afford. But his talent gave him a contract with Barcelona. Got a red card in his first game for Argentina. But he slowly rose up into one of the best players in the world eventually become *the* best. He carries his team to the World Cup final in 2014 but his team just isn't good enough to support him. So close to the one trophy he values the most but is out of his reach. Heart break. Won everything for his club but people called him a fraud for not winning anything with his national team.
He decides he can't take it anymore and quits. But changes his decision. Suddenly he learns that the club that gave him everything can't re sign him because of financial regulations. This is the lowest point of his career and the point where the main character is the weakest.
He finally manages to win Copa America and prove he's still not finished. He's still one of the best. He finds an unlikely new team in PSG. Even though he struggles in the first season, soon he adapts and starts an amazing run of form in the next season. His starts his last ever World Cup but immediately is hit with a setback when they lose to Saudi Arabia. He's subject to jokes and ridicule all around the world. But they come back stronger. And even stronger in the next game. And even stronger still in the one after that. Meanwhile on the other side of the bracket France is running amok amount their opponents and look genuinely unstoppable. France is the final boss.
They meet in the final. His very last World Cup game. It's all or nothing. His team goes up 2-0 and dominate France for a good 75 minutes. But Mbappe scores a double and pulls France back in the game. Messi tries his all and scores another goal in extra time. But Mbappe isn't going to let it end so easily. He equalizes immediately. The match is going to penalties. Now at this point Messi can't do it himself. He needs his teammates to show up. But unlike 2014 this team is different. They're hungrier. They want to fight. They won't give up so easily.
Messi does his part. He converts his penalty kick. Now all he can do is wait...
His teammates finally do it. They win it. They beat the final boss. The unstoppable juggernaut, France. They do it for Argentina and for Messi. Messi on his last World Cup game wins the biggest trophy in the world. The one he coveted above all else. He wins *the* trophy.
If this isn't the story if the main character of football then I don't know what is.",118,1671408950,

Let's see:
* From Argentina's 36 game unbeaten streak to losing the first WC match to Saudi to mounting a come-back and defeating everyone on the way to the final, led by Messi.
* From France's dominance in every game leading up to the final, led by Mbappe. Despite missing Kante, Pogba and Benzema. Written off initially but went through their games unphased.
* Argentina dominating the first 75 minutes while France couldn't get their bearings before two successive goals from Mbappe to equalize. Messi with a last minute shot that Lloris saves like a beast.
* Messi coming clutch in ET to snatch the lead once again on the heels of a rejuvenated France before Mbappe converted yet another penalty in the 118'. Martinez with another clutch save as well.
* After 2 successive comebacks, a penalty shoot-out where, Argentina, despite all signs pointing towards a mental choke having come this far manages to convert all their penalties while Martinez pulls off yet another elite PK performance.
* Messi winning the WC in his last ever WC appearance, after willing his team to a final and scoring 2 goals in the final. Safe to say he's the undisputed modern-era GOAT and can finally rest knowing he's won it all.
* Mbappe showing us why he's one of the future greats and an absolute phenom. A hat-trick in the final. Literally the only thing that stood between Argentina and the trophy. To have 11 WC goals in 2 WC's having already won one and nearly single-handedly winning another at the age of 23 shows why he is truly elite. I truly feel bad but excited to see this guy break records.
* GK's showing why they matter. Both Lloris and Martinez were fucking immense. Penalties are always a tough one but being able to make critical saves in open-play and in shoot-outs is testament to how good these guys were today.
Truly an emotional roller-coaster and an insane WC final from what most thought was a one-sided game. But that's why this is the best **fucking game** and no sport will top it for me.",66,1671388141,
