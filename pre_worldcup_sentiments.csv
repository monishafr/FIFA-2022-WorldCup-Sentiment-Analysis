Allez Les Bleus. France used to suffer immensely in soccer I still remember losing in 2010 France was so depressing losing every match I cried. We had a decent team but not what we were used to when Henry, Deschamps, Zidane, or even thuram but look now. I'm not being negative this is my opinion you can either accept or not but disagreeing with me doesn't make something negative. The MLS is going to improve unless they start drawing young talent that's isn't Carlos vela he's 3.5 star player at best you need those 4-5 star players like Foden, Ali, Greenwood, Fernan, or Chiesa. It comes down to the tactics usa uses compared to European or South American Clubs. European teams typically run a false nine or they have 2 mids one attacking and one defensive, they also constantly watch their lines go look up Thomas Muller 2010 world cup performance to this day that is the best play I have seen from a player at that level. Alot of Europe is balanced soccer it isn't heavy on the attack or defense but more to the tune of the momentum. The thing usa lacks deeply is height. South American clubs make up for the lack of height with the crazy attack style they play and It's heavy on the counter attacks. 
The US just isn't their financially to afford these players either nor would they get love. Pirlo one of the greatest to play came to New York FC and during an interview he said he loved the MLS because he was just a regular person kot many knew him when he played for Juve he said he would be locked in the stadium for 3 hours after matches due to how crazy fans got over his popularity.",1,1649209549.0

The referee blows the whistle.

Ronaldo breathes in. Breathes out. Looks back at Santos.

""You took my family""

Focuses Bounou.

""He took my friends""

Pulls up his shorts and looks at Santos again.

""You took all that was dear to me""

The arena exhales silence.

""I can't get this back, but I can do this for friendship, FOR MY FRIENDS""

He runs up, fire is coming out of his shoes,

""RONALDOUKEN""

He blasts the ball, it thunders past Bounou's face, him standing still, ripping the net and smashing the net camera into pieces.

Ronaldo falls to the ground, exhausted,

""Bruno...Senpai...I""

He faints.
